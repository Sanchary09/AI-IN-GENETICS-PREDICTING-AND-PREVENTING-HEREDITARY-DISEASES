# AI-IN-GENETICS-PREDICTING-AND-PREVENTING-HEREDITARY-DISEASES
Hereditary disorders resulting from genetic mutations present considerable challenges to both affected individuals and healthcare infrastructures globally. Timely detection and preventive strategies are crucial in lessening the impact of diseases such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Huntingtonâ€™s disease. This project harnesses the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to interpret genetic data, uncover meaningful patterns, and predict the risk of inheritable conditions. It utilizes publicly available genetic datasets, performing preprocessing to extract critical features linked to various genetic disorders. Advanced machine learning techniques and deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are employed to build and train predictive models. These models undergo rigorous evaluation using performance indicators such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC-AUC score. The system also incorporates a personalized risk assessment module that generates individual risk scores and offers tailored preventive guidance, including lifestyle modifications and genetic counseling. A user-centric web application facilitates seamless access for medical professionals and researchers, enabling genetic data uploads, predictive insights, and risk-based recommendations. By integrating cutting-edge AI methodologies with genomic analysis, this initiative aims to transform the landscape of early detection and proactive management of genetic diseases, ultimately enhancing patient care and alleviating pressures on healthcare systems.
